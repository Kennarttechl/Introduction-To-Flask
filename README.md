When a user submit a form flask generate CSRF Token with the secret_key and stored it 
in a hidden form field withing the form


2. **CSRF Token Generation:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a security vulnerability. To prevent it, Flask generates a CSRF token. This token is like a secret code unique to each user session.


In summary, the secret key is used to generate a CSRF token, and this token is added to each form to protect against CSRF attacks. The CSRF token ensures that the form submission is legitimate and not an attack from another site.
